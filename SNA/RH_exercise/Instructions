This example looks at an undirected network that represents some of the project groups of an XPTO company. The connection between nodes A and B
means that person A and B work together (or, that person A reports to person B). This network represents six main projects:

• Department 1 (D1) - Snopp, Gukrishnan, Leon, Kabutz. Snopp reports to Chapman.
• Department 2 (D2) - Oliver, Gotti, Patrick, Zhuo. Oliver reports to Chapman.
• Department 3 (D3) - Gotti, Leon, Kabutz. Gotti reports to Chapman.
• Department 4 (D4). Yu reports to Chapman on this project.
• Department 4a (D4a) - Polark, Chang, Weng, Angel. Polark reports to Yu.
• Department 4b (D4B) - Christoph, Nardo, Gotti, Zhuo. Christoph reports to Yu.
• Department 4c (D4C) -Graffe, Zhuo, Hund. Graffe reports to Yu.

Objective: to make a complete analysis of the measures and to detail insights that might be interesting, to present to the HR director. The Director is
very concerned about Gotti and Chang, as the market is watching them.
