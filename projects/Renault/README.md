# üöó **Report - Renault Group: Customer Usage Data Science and Analytics (for Component Optimization)**

Welcome to the directory of my internship project conducted at **Renault Group - Ampere Cars Division**, as part of the **Master's program in Data Science at Telecom SudParis ‚Äì Institut Polytechnique de Paris**. This project focused on **analyzing vehicle usage data** for optimizing automotive components, using **advanced statistical techniques** such as **bootstrap**, **jackknife**, and **regression** to calculate confidence intervals. Below, you'll find an overview of the internship's objectives, methodology, and key findings.

## üìú **Project Overview**

This internship aimed to develop methods for constructing **confidence intervals** from both real-world customer usage data and simulation data. By understanding how vehicles are used under different conditions, we can optimize key components to ensure **efficiency**, **durability**, and **performance**.

### üöÄ **Key Achievements**:

- **Developed methodologies** to calculate confidence intervals using techniques like **bootstrap** and **regression**.
- Conducted **three case studies** analyzing:
  - Number of trips per vehicle per day.
  - The impact of speed on severe conditions for the automotive differential.
  - Average speed profile of customers.
- **Demonstrated the importance of confidence intervals** in upper percentiles, particularly for extreme usage scenarios like the **99th percentile**, where variability is higher.
- Directly contributed to **component optimization** for electric vehicles, strengthening Renault's leadership in electric mobility.

## üéØ **Internship Objectives**

### **Main Objectives**:
- Explore and propose **methods for constructing confidence intervals** applicable to customer usage workflows.
- Develop and document a **tool for estimating confidence intervals**.

## üîß **Methodology & Techniques**

During the internship, several **advanced statistical techniques** were applied to account for data uncertainty, enabling **robust predictions** about real-world usage patterns:

- **Bootstrap Method**: Repeatedly sampling the data to generate distributions and estimate variability.
- **Jackknife Method**: Removing one data point at a time to understand its impact on overall variability.
- **Regression Models**: To identify relationships between variables and predict future behavior.
  
These techniques were essential for generating **reliable confidence intervals** in real-world usage data, especially in highly variable conditions that are hard to predict with conventional testing.

## üîç **Case Studies**

### 1. **Trips Per Vehicle Per Day**:
Analyzed the variability in the number of trips made by customers daily. Confidence intervals helped understand **extreme usage patterns** and their implications on vehicle wear and tear.

### 2. **Impact of Speed on Differential Conditions**:
Studied how driving at higher speeds imposes **severe conditions** on vehicle differentials, providing insights for **component optimization** under stressful conditions.

### 3. **Customer Speed Profiles**:
Analyzed the **average speed profiles** of customers, focusing on the variability at the 99th percentile to assess **component durability** in extreme usage scenarios.
