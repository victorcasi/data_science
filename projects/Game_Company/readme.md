# üéÆ Player Ranking Prediction Model for Game Post-Statistics

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the final rank of a player (on a scale from 1 for first place to 0 for last) based on post-game statistics. The dataset includes anonymized information on various aspects of gameplay, such as kills, assists, distances traveled, and more. This project showcases my end-to-end data science workflow, from data cleaning and exploration to feature engineering and modeling, presented in a Jupyter notebook format for clarity and replicability.

## üìú Project Overview

In this project, I predict a player‚Äôs final ranking based on their post-game statistics. The dataset includes approximately 50k training entries and 5k testing entries. Each row represents the stats of a single player after a match. The game types include solo, duo, and team modes, with varied team sizes and player counts per game.

## üöÄ Approach Summary

Here is a brief summary of my approach:

### Data Analysis
The data analysis phase provided valuable initial insights into variable distributions, behaviors, and correlations. During this phase, I identified potential issues and interesting relationships, establishing a foundational understanding for further refinements and enhancements.

### Data Cleaning
During the data cleaning phase, I recategorized the `gameType` variable and removed problematic or redundant data points. I experimented with outlier removal but found it did not significantly improve model outcomes. Careful preprocessing ensured that the data was well-structured and primed for effective feature engineering.

### Feature Engineering
I categorized features into quantitative and qualitative types and applied techniques like one-hot encoding and standard scaling. I tested additional features, such as total distance traveled and combined weapons statistics, but found these yielded limited improvements in model performance.

### Modeling and Explainability
In the modeling stage, I implemented various models, aligning metrics with project objectives. I also explored deep learning approaches, performed hyperparameter tuning through grid search, and assessed feature importance. This thorough approach aimed to maximize model robustness and derive actionable insights for business applications.

## üîç Key Data Points and Variables

- **assists**: Number of enemy players damaged and then killed by teammates.
- **damages**: Total damage dealt, with self-inflicted damage removed.
- **kills, headshots, roadKills**: Various kill metrics, including the number of kills and specific actions such as headshots or kills while driving.
- **distances**: Metrics for distances traveled on foot, by vehicle, or swimming.
- **gameType**: Game mode, such as solo or team-based modes.
- **rankPts & winPts**: External ranking metrics similar to Elo ratings, based on kills or wins.
- **winRankPercentage**: The target variable for the prediction (0 - 1 scale representing last to first place).
